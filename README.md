This is a RO-Crate example for a small dataset of KCDC called `KASCADE_HighEnergyData_runs_0877-7417_ROOT`, which is provided for download as a zip archive.
The repo's content:

- Folder `KASCADE_HighEnergyData_runs_0877-7417_ROOT/` - a RO-Crate:

    + `events.root` - the dataset  in the ROOT binary tree format
    + `info.txt` - info about selected variables, units, subsystem groups - not the same as in the GUI metadata file and no general DublinCore context
    + `EULA.pdf` - licence
    + `ro-crate-metadata.json` - RO-Crate Metadata File
    + `ro-crate-preview.html` - RO-Crate HTML preview (autogenerated).

- `response_1763380979215.xml` - metadata record for the Dataset
- `KASCADE_HighEnergyData_runs_0877-7417_ROOT.pdf` - human-readable description available in GUI
- Examples of working with ROOT files in Python:

    + `Read_ROOT_File_example.ipynb` - uses PyROOT. For illustrative purposes, it will not work without ROOT software being installed.
    + `Read_ROOT_File_to_Pandas_Dataframe_UPROOT_example.ipynb` - uses uproot library, can be run independently.
- This `README` file.
